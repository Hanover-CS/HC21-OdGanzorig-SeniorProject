# HomeworkTracker
HomeworkTracker is an application that tracks your homework progress and sends you homework reminders based on your input.
1. Home Tab is the first screen that the user will see after logging into the application. The user will be able to see the
list of all added classes and homework with specific details on this screen and also remove them at will. 
2. By navigating to the Classes Tab, the user will be able to add new classes by providing a name, start and end date, 
name of the instructor, class days and time. 
3. In the Homework Tab, the user will be able to add a new homework by providing a description, related class, 
type, due date, priority, and a reminder. This section also sorts the homework based on completion so that the user can
differentiate the completed home assignments from upcoming ones. Upon completion, the user has to click the Completed
button inside of each homework item to let the application know about it. 
3. In the Calendar Tab, the user can view all of his present home assignments from a calendar by clicking on certain dates. 
The list of assignments due on that date will appear below. The user can not add or remove anything here.
